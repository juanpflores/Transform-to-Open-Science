# August Special Topic Webinar 

Exploring Citizen Science: Help NASA Make Space Discoveries

Join NASA’s Transform to Open Science team for a discussion of NASA’s citizen scientist projects. These initiatives provide open access to data and collaboration opportunities with scientists. Over 2 million citizen scientists have made significant discoveries, including exoplanets, comets, star-forming regions, and more.

Marc Kuchner, citizen scientist officer at NASA will overview NASA’s growing citizen science portfolio, successes, strategies, and best practices. We will also explore astronomy-themed citizen science projects like Backyard Worlds: Planet 9, Cool Neighbors, and the upcoming Exoasteroids project.

You’ll hear the perspectives of Dr. Aaron Meisner, a scientist and project leader, and Dan Caselden, a project volunteer whose discoveries have been published in Nature and observed with the Webb space telescope.
